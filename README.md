 A PREDICTION REQUEST FOR HEART DISEASE CLASSIFICATION
 Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Watson Machine Learning API.
This Python script authenticates with IBM Cloud, sends patient health data to a deployed machine learning model, and returns a prediction indicating the likelihood of heart disease based on key clinical features.

üîê Step 1: Authentication
We begin by authenticating with IBM Cloud using a secure API key.
IBM uses IAM ‚Äî Identity and Access Management ‚Äî to control access.
So, we send a request to the IAM token endpoint and receive an access token, which we use in all subsequent API calls.

üì§ Step 2: Sending Patient Data
Next, we prepare a structured set of input features, including:

age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels,

blood pressure, heart rate,

and other clinical indicators.

These are the same fields the model was trained on, using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

We format this data into JSON and send it to the model deployment endpoint on IBM Watson Machine Learning.

ü§ñ Step 3: Model Prediction
The model processes the input and returns:

A prediction ‚Äî either 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (presence of heart disease)

And a probability score, showing the confidence of the prediction

For example, if the output is 1.0 with a probability of 0.688, it means there's a 68.8% chance that the patient has heart disease, based on the input features.

üß† Why This Matters
This kind of solution shows how AI can assist medical professionals by providing a quick, data-driven second opinion.
It‚Äôs not a replacement for doctors, but a decision support tool that can improve early detection and potentially save lives.

‚úÖ Conclusion
In summary, this project showcases:

How to securely connect to IBM Cloud,

Send patient data for inference,

And receive clinically relevant predictions using a deployed machine learning model.

Thank you!‚Äù
